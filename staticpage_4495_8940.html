  1. Choose the right dog!<br><br>There is more than one dog out there that would suit you, in fact I can promise you, there are thousands! So donâ€™t think that this is a needle in a haystack sort of job. <br><br>However you do want to choose a puppy or dog that will suit you and your lifestyle.<br><br>So the first question to ask is whether a dog or puppy is best for you?<br><br>There are advantages and disadvantages to both. <br><br>With an older dog you can tell their personality and character easier as it is more developed...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can tell if they're a couch potato or a challenger!<br><br>Also with an older dog there will be no need to go through all the toilet training etc.&nbsp; <br><br>For those of you unfamiliar with this it can be very time consuming and requires you to be around most of the time (if not all the time to start with). So if you need to get back to work soon after getting your new puppy, an older dog may be better.<br><br>A few of the other factors to think about are:<br>how much time you have,<br>the size of dog you like, <br>the amount of shedding they might do<br>the grooming required, and <br>the amount of energy your dog will have. <br><br>Take your time to think of all the different options and then meet several dogs before making your decision.<br><br>
