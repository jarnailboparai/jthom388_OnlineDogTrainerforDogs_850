  <h3>2 Quality Of The Solution - Choose Carefully. </h3><br><h4>Dog trainer in person â€“ </h4><font size="4">Unfortunately the dog training world has recently exploded with thousands of dog lovers turning into dog trainers almost overnight. The two are not the same thing.<br><br>Just because your friend loves dogs does not mean that they are able to help you with your dogs! <br><br>Many dog trainers have qualifications that are not worth the paper they are&nbsp; written on and others have absolutely no experience at all. That said, there are some fine dog trainers out there, but finding them is not always easy. <br><br>If you are looking to use one, make sure that you have some reliable recommendations from people you know first. <br><br>One of the big advantages of a dog trainer coming to visit you in person is that they are able to see your dog in the flesh, watch them and observe them, which can help to form a personalized solution.<br><br>If they&nbsp; are experienced then they will also be able to tailor things easily to&nbsp; your home and personality.</font> <br><br><h4>Online Dog Trainer -</h4><br><font size="4">The benefit of an online dog training solution however is that you will usually find the experience that is being offered is far greater than that of&nbsp; a dog trainer living just round the corner. <br><br>The sheer quality of the&nbsp; solution being offered, the total number of dogs that they have worked with and the methods they can show you will be more extensive. <br><br>In summary, whatever option you choose, do your homework first.<br><br>Get referrals, talk to people who have used the services and read the&nbsp; testimonials. Are they&nbsp; recent and how genuine do they look.
