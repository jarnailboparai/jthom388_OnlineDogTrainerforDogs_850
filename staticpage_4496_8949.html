  4 Support – Don’t Get Left High And Dry <br><br>Dog trainer in person -<br><br>Some dog trainers will visit multiple times, however you need to check that<br>this is all included into the price. If it is not then beware that you could be opening a can of worms. <br><br>The more you pay the more you desperately want a solution however there sometimes comes a point when you realize that no matter how many visits they make the&nbsp; solution is not going to happen like you had hoped.&nbsp; <br><br>Telephone or email support, if it is included in the price, is well worth it provided they are willing to give you the time when you ask for it. <br><br>Online Dog Trainer -<br><br>Most online dog training website include a forum where you are able to ask questions and receive answers.<br><br>Some sites will allow you to add links to video clips which can be watched to help the dog trainer answering the questions get a good picture of what is going on. <br><br>So you could take a video of your dog being naughty and upload that to say, YouTube, and then ask the dog trainer in the Forum to look at it to get a better understanding of the problem. <br><br>Winner – Draw<br><br>
