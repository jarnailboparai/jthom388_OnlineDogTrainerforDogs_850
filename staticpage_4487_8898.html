  Question 4 How does the pack leader behave?<br><br>All dogs worldwide, regardless of breed use the same ways to check to establish the pack leader. The best way to learn about how to put it into practice is to watch it being done on video as I have done through one of the video based web sites. The important areas to take control in are the following:<br><br>The pack leader will be in total calm control when your dog barks and alerts you to danger. This includes anything that your dog may perceive as dangerous and barks at in and around the property <br><br>On the walk your dog should not pull you at a single stage, even the beginning! Learning to walk your dog properly can only really be learnt through video as I have found out!<br><br>If you are the pack leader then your dog should be able to relax and switch off completely inside the house. If your dog is always switched on most of the time and can’t relax then that is your dog on pack leader duty!<br><br>Getting your dog to switch off is directly connected to how you meet and greet your dog after your return home. You need to watch it on video because it is so subtle but it is the difference between being the pack leader or the follower.<br><br>Lastly, feeding your dog correctly will establish who is the pack leader and there is much more to it than asking your dog to sit! Also if you have a dog that is “not food motivated” then you may be in for a surprise!<br><br>There is one site that shows you – using video – exactly how to become the pack leader and how crucial it is to changing any behavioral issue.<br><br>If you want to understand more about this topic or see the videos that explain everything then simply take a look at The Online Dog Trainer here http://jtbilliam.doggyd4n.hop.clickbank.net<br><br>
