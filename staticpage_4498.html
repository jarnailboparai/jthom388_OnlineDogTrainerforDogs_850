  Review of theOnlineDogTrainer<br><br>You might be able to guess that I really like Doggy Dan and his training philosophy, otherwise I wouldn’t have made this App to showcase how fantastic he is!<br><br>This is just a brief review of what Doggy Dan has available on his site:<br><br>He has over 250 videos addressing just about any dog problem you might possibly imagine, such as:<br><br>* aggression towards people, objects, other dogs or animals...<br>* barking at the window, in the car, for attention, when left alone...<br>* being hyperactive, pulling on the lead, not responding when called...<br><br>Dan shows you everything from becoming the pack leader to training a puppy, from allowing you to take a bone from your dog, to calming your dog down in the car.<br><br>On the videos you see real life consultations showing how Dan uses his voice, his body language and the dog's reactions. I<br><br>f you want a simple but powerful approach to developing a better relationship with your new dog or puppy, or you want to stop any unwanted behaviors then TheOnlineDogTrainer.com is for you.<br><br>Doggy Dan deals with dog problems like separation anxiety, jumping on the furniture, running away and even fears and phobias.&nbsp; <br><br>Or maybe you have a puppy, there’s a week by week collection of videos as Dan brings up Moses, showing his training from 8 weeks old right through to 1 year old. <br>It really is stunning footage as you see the pup learning all the commands, and growing into quite an amazing dog.<br><br>Also remember the Royal New Zealand SPCA&nbsp; promote Doggy Dan on their home page and actively at their rescue centers. <br><br>That in itself speaks volumes about the kind and gentle training methods and the effectiveness of Dan’s site.<br><br>Dan is currently offering a 3 day trial membership for $1 so you can have a good look round the site, watch as many of the videos as you like, or maybe visit the forum where Doggy Dan answers questions himself.<br><br>I highly recommend you GO FOR IT!&nbsp; Click the link below and start your trial membership today.<br><br>Take advantage of the $1 Trial for 3 Days here:<br>
