  2. Time commitment<br><br>The amount of time required to spend with your dog can really vary from dog to dog and also changes over the lifetime of the dog. <br><br>Young dogs, puppies and up to the age of 2 can often require quite a lot more than older dogs, who are often happy to lie around more and sleep during the day.<br><br>A very important consideration to make is to get an idea of how much energy your dog will have and how much exercise you can give them. <br><br>Different breeds tend to have different amounts of energy but the personality and character of the dog will have just as much influence on the dog.<br><br>For example, if you get a high energy Border Collie dog or Boxer dog then they are likely to need way more exercise than a chilled out St Bernard or Pug. <br><br>A high energy dog could need 2-3 half hour walks, runs every day. <br><br>A smaller low energy dog may be very happy charging around the back garden and playing and may not need to get out to the park every day.<br><br>Making sure that you can give your dog the exercise, time and stimulation is crucial, because the energy that they have, has to go somewhere!<br><br>
