  Question 1. Do I really need to be the pack leader?<br><br>Lets look at the facts…<br><br>Dog are pack animals. There are leaders and followers. You can’t change that. It is simply how dogs work… and it works very well.<br><br>The pack leaders make the decisions and the followers follow. Simple.<br><br>In the wild dogs are pack animals. They have descended from the wolf, which is a pack animal. <br><br>And what most people don't realize is even in your home you form a pack. <br><br>Sometimes there are other members in the pack, maybe children, more than one dog, even a cat…<br><br>The fact remains that dogs will view all these beings as members of the pack, and the pack leader in their eyes must make all the big decisions.<br><br>Now in many homes there are dogs who are just too happy to please. They simply do as you ask without any questioning. They are easy to train and the owners are convinced that it is all due to how good they are as owners.<br><br>You may even know people like this. They have this amazing, easy, placid dog and you can’t work out how because the owner doesn’t seem to do anything special. In fact you may well be a bit cheesed off that your dog causes you so much grief.<br><br>Doggy Dan says:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How can it be this way? Well, allow me to let you into a secret. The fact is this… It usually has nothing to do with how good the owners are… Some dogs are simply much easier to train others. That’s it!”<br><br>Trust me…if you have an easy dog then you can get away with so much – and many people do. They have a dog for years convinced that they are great with dogs and know exactly what they are doing, always dishing out advice about how they do it when in reality they just have a very easy dog!<br><br>However if you have a difficult, very smart, driven dog then you have to know fully what you are doing and the messages that you are giving your dog. <br><br>It is much more difficult to train these dogs if you do not know what you are doing. The secret to training these types of dogs is… <br><br>to ensure that YOU are the pack leader in the home. <br><br>Only then will they listen to you.<br><br>Doggy Dan says:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “And the difference between these easy and difficult dogs has nothing to do with breeds. It's all about character and personality. You'll never be able to tell until they're in your home. Kind of sucks, hey!”<br><br>But it makes sense now as to why you are struggling. It’s why you are constantly bribing your dog, battling with them. <br><br>It's like trying to swim upstream…<br><br>the struggle never ends, they never give in, and you're exhausted. <br><br>It's all because in your dog's mind you are not the pack leader…YET !<br><br>But hold on. Here's the good news... I can help.<br><br>You see if you are struggling…I can promise you that becoming the pack leader is the first thing you need to do. <br><br>And I have just discovered a fantastic resource which shows you how to become the pack leader in the most amazing gentle way.<br><br>But let's discuss the next point before I tell you where this fantastic solution is.<br><br>
