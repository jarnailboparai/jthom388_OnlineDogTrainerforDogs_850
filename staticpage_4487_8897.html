  Question 3. How to Become The Pack Leader?<br><br>Of all the questions that people ask “how to become the pack leader” is the big one! <br><br>This is by far the most important question: how to convince your dog that you are the person in charge. <br><br>Think of the pack leader as the decision maker - where you should go on the walk, how to behave in different situations and how to respond to all the strange things that are out there.<br><br>When you understand how a dog pack works you soon realize the importance that the pack leader makes all the decisions. If you leave it up to your dog then there a big chance that your dog is going to get some things very wrong and make a mistake!<br><br>In order to understand how to become the pack leader you must first recognize that the following means nothing to a dog….<br><br>What car you drive, the size of your house, the money you earn or the fact that you speak languages! Your dog would happily swap all of that for a nice snack!<br><br>Asking your dog to sit before her dinner falls a long way short of what you need to be achieving to become the pack leader and walking ahead through doorways is only necessary when your dog is on the lead.<br><br>Doggy Dan says:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Dominating your dog is certainly not the way to become the pack leader in fact this can back fire badly on you later on if you teach your dog that physical strength is what it is all about.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Whilst you may force your dog into submission it will not be convincing your dog’s mind that you are worthy of the position and that you should become the pack leader only that you are a bit of a bully.”<br>
