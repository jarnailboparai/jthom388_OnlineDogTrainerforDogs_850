  Question 2. Is the pack leader aggressive in their behavior?<br><br>The thing to realize is that the best pack leaders are calm and consistent.<br><br>They are firm but fair, there is no screaming, no shouting, no hurting, and no need for smacking. <br><br>All those things that used to be associated with being the pack leader many years ago are old school approaches.<br><br>Old school dog training used to teach that you needed to physically dominate your dog. It involved a lot of force and confrontation with your dog which would often turn ugly.<br><br>The best dog training is where people are taught how to actually win their dogs mind in a calm and gentle way, so that their dogs accept them as the pack leader through choice, not fear. <br><br>This new dog training method is set to revolutionize the way we work with and train our dogs in the home.<br><br>By learning how our dogs see the world we can then adjust our behavior to communicate clearly to them in a way they understand. <br><br>It's crucial that we give them the right messages, rather than simply applying human psychology to a dog. <br><br>Let’s face it, we would never apply fish or bird psychology to a dog, so why do we always apply human psychology?<br><br>We are primates, evolved from the apes, but your dog is a canine evolved from the wolves and there are some subtle but crucial differences!<br><br>When you understand your dog's mind and where they are coming from there is no need for fear or aggression in training…<br><br>if you are struggling then the chances are that your dog does not see you as the pack leader.<br><br>
