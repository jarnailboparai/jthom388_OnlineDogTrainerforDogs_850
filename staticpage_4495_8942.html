  <h3>3.Setting up the home before</h3><font size="4">There is nothing more crazy than bringing home a dog and then deciding that you need to build a fence or patch up the holes to keep them in!<br><br>Yet so many people do this. Itâ€™s crazy because from the word go you are not able to let your puppy or dog run around outside!<br><br>You get stressed so your dog becomes stressed...<br><br>You set yourself up to fail! <br><br>So mend that fence and dog proof the garden now. <br><br>Here are a couple of other key things to consider.<br><br>Decide now on a small area where you can contain your puppy. (A dog can be kept in a room but puppies will sometimes need to be contained at night). <br><br>Think about buying a puppy pen, a crate or simply creating a safe place that you can put your puppy to rest when you need a break and where they sleep. <br><br>This safe place could be a laundry, bathroom or washroom.<br><br>Get hold of some toys, chews, and old objects that your puppy can chew safely for when they arrive home.<br><br>Decide now what areas you want your puppy or dog to be in and which areas are out of bounds. <br><br>This will then mean that you start off on the right step.</font><br><br>
